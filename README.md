Overview of the Project
Project Title: Temperature Monitoring System using Temperature Sensor and LCD/Serial Monitor

Objective:
- To design and develop a temperature monitoring system that can read and display temperature data using a temperature sensor and an LCD or serial monitor.
- To demonstrate the use of a temperature sensor and its integration with a microcontroller to display temperature data.

System Components:
1. Temperature Sensor: A digital temperature sensor (e.g., DS18B20, TMP36, or LM35) that can measure temperature accurately.
2. Microcontroller: A microcontroller board (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi, or ESP32) that can read data from the temperature sensor and display it on an LCD or serial monitor.
3. LCD or Serial Monitor: An LCD display or a serial monitor (e.g., serial terminal on a computer) to display the temperature data.
4. Breadboard and Jumper Wires: A breadboard and jumper wires to connect the temperature sensor, microcontroller, and LCD or serial monitor.

System Operation:
1. The temperature sensor measures the ambient temperature and sends the data to the microcontroller.
2. The microcontroller reads the temperature data from the sensor and processes it.
3. The microcontroller then displays the temperature data on the LCD or serial monitor.
4. The system can be programmed to update the temperature data at regular intervals or in real-time.

Skills and Knowledge Required:
1. Basic electronics and circuitry knowledge
2. Programming skills in a language supported by the microcontroller (e.g., C, C++, Python)
3. Familiarity with temperature sensors and their operation
4. Knowledge of LCD or serial monitor interfacing with microcontrollers

Applications and Extensions:
1. Environmental monitoring (e.g., temperature, humidity, air quality)
2. Industrial automation (e.g., temperature control, monitoring)
3. Medical devices (e.g., temperature monitoring, patient care)
4. Home automation (e.g., temperature control, energy management)
5. IoT-based applications (e.g., temperature monitoring, data logging)
